# Handwritten_digit_reader_and_calculator
Handwritten digit prediction and using them for calculation using computer vision and MNIST Dataset

Two codes, one calculating the output of the algebric problem. (using pytorch)
Other for predicting multiple digits (It was an assignment for internship on internshala.) - of course, I didn't got selected. (using tensorflow)

working on adding matrix calculations to the model too.
 
 Dataset used - MNIST Dataset
