# Handwritten_digit_reader_and_calculator
Handwritten digit prediction and using them for calculation using computer vision and MNIST Dataset


Three codes, one calculating the output of the algebric problem. (using pytorch)<br>
anther for predicting multiple digits (It was an assignment for internship on internshala.) - of course, I didn't got selected. (using tensorflow)<br>
and last for classifying 0s and 1s apart from scratch. (using numpy)<br>

working on adding matrix calculations to the first model too.<br>
 
 Dataset used - MNIST Dataset
