# Handwritten_digit_reader_and_calculator
Handwritten digit prediction and using them for calculation using computer vision and MNIST Dataset

Three codes, one calculating the output of the algebric problem. (using pytorch)
anther for predicting multiple digits (It was an assignment for internship on internshala.) - of course, I didn't got selected. (using tensorflow)
and last for classifying 0s and 1s apart from scratch. (using numpy)

working on adding matrix calculations to the first model too.
 
 Dataset used - MNIST Dataset
